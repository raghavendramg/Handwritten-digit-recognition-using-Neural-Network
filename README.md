# Handwritten-digit-recognition-using-Neural-Network

The handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem which has been approached
using various machine learning models like Decision Trees, Support Vector
Machines, Neural networks, etc. In this case,  backpropagation algorithm for Neural
Networks is used to approach this problem of classifying handwritten digits.
